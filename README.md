# Simple Pomodoro Clock
&nbsp;
A simple countdown timer that uses the [Pomodoro techinique] to allow one to work more efficiently. Website available via this [link].
&nbsp;
### How to run:
1. Install Node.js and React.
1. Use `npm start`
&nbsp;

### Lessons learned:
&nbsp;
Learned using lifecylce methods on how to create the count down. Also, applied simple animation and color scheme to package the app visually.
&nbsp;
### Improvements to be made:
&nbsp;
Perhaps adding an animation to the countdown display box to phase through several colors to make it more visual to the viewer and alert them that a count down is occuring as opposed to just looking at the digits decreasing.
